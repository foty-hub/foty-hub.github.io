title: "Reflections on an MSc"
subtitle: "The good, the bad and the third one."

Two days ago I submitted my thesis, concluding a year-long Master's in Machine Learning at UCL. Now that things have come to a close, I wanted to write a short post reflecting on the MSc for posterity.

## The Good
Overall, I'm very glad I decided to take the Master's. It gave me a first taste of research, and it turned out to be great fun! Trying new things, coming up with ideas, flexing the creative problem-solving part of the brain; after years of writing code where I more or less knew what I'd get in advance, it's been refreshing to work on problems without predefined solutions. In contrast to a lot of professional work where you're expected to get the answer people want to hear, research feels honest. You don't know the answer, but no one does, so just try your best to figure it out.

A big seeling point of the MSc turned out to be the other students. I was surrounded by whip-smart people. On the first day of the programme I ended up chatting to some coursemates, who all turned out to either be Cambridge mathematicians, patent holders, startup founders or prior maths PhDs. Being surrounded by so many sharp, motivated people is really energising; it pushes you to improve and keep up. And the better courses encouraged collaboration, like Tim Rockt√§schel's excellent Open-Endedness module.

Lastly, the great thing about the Master's has been time. Time to work on side projects, to read about new ideas and work on a thesis for three months uninterrupted. That time is ultimately what convinced to pursue a PhD, although the jury's still out on that decision.

## The Bad
As much as I appreciate having taken the Master's, at times it was in spite of, not because of UCL. The teaching was variable, and there was a strong reliance on the "flipped-classroom" structure; no in-person lectures, only videos and Q&A sessions. I found that the best courses were taught by professors who rejected the flipped classroom in favour of typical lectures. These lectures were more engaging, the questions being asked were more insightful, and I reckon chatting to other students afterwards is preferable to closing a video and talking to nobody.

Similarly, the quality of the exams was variable. I'd never really thought about exam quality before, but you notice when they're bad. Verbatim repeats of previous papers, negligible coverage of the course content, or requiring you to use concepts which were never taught. The one exception was Brooks Paige's excellent paper on Bayesian Deep Learning. It was the only paper where I was genuinely curious about the questions being asked, they were interesting, challenging and novel.

My final gripe is that the content at UCL is fairly archaic. Occasionally I stumble across course videos posted by Stanford or MIT, like this excellent [introduction to distributed training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MvD-XsowsE&ab_channel=StanfordOnline) by Justin Johnson, and the difference is stark. There is really nothing at UCL which teaches the fundamentals of modern ML like transformer architectures, diffusion or GPU code. There's a balance to be struck between teaching fundamentals vs. novelties, but I personally felt that UCL leans too far towards the basics.

## The Rest
There were some other observations I made from my time at UCL, neither positive nor negative.

My main old-man-shakes-fist-at-cloud observation is that grade inflation is real. Marks were markedly easier to earn than during my undergrad degree. My highest mark in undergrad was around 80% for a course on General Relativity, which was a bit of an anomaly. At UCL I received 90+% on multiple courses, which meant that before I began my thesis I was more or less guaranteed a distinction. I don't know if this is really an issue, but it does make a good mark feel a little cheaper. I felt like marks were anti-correlated with how well I was doing.

Another thing that surprised me was the absolute ubiquity of generative AI. I reckon half the cohort's coursework could have been submitted via ChatGPT share link. You'd see jokes that people's MSc research topic was "whether ChatGPT can write a thesis." It really is everywhere. I also use generative AI-I don't think there's anything evil about it-but I found myself paring my usage back after feeling overly dependent.

The last detail that stood out was that the cohort was really much sociable than I'd expected. A couple friends and I would try to drum up interest in a trip to the student bar once every couple weeks, and you'd get maybe 5-10 people out of 200+. Maybe I'm a bad conversationalist but that still seems low! Maybe it's because it was a one-year Master's, or people already had friends in London, or the students were all workaholics (unlikely). It did feel like you'd go to lectures in the morning: 200 people would file in, and the last lecture would end and everyone would escape post-haste.
