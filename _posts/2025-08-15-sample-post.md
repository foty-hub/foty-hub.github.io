This is a sample blog post.

Here's how you can embed a video from YouTube:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


And here's how you would embed a self-hosted video:

<video width="560" height="315" controls>
  <source src="/videos/my-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
