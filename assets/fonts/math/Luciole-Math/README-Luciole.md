Luciole package
===============

## Description

This package provides four Unicode Math text fonts `Luciole-*.ttf’ and
a companion maths font `Luciole-Math.otf’.  
They have been developed explicitly for visually impaired people
and are the result of a collaboration between the Regional Technical Center
for Visual Impairment, the type-design studio typographies.fr and
the mathematician Daniel Flipo. The Luciole project received a grant from
the Swiss Ceres Foundation and the PEP69 association, and support from
the DIPHE laboratory at the Université Lumière Lyon 2 and the association
GUTenberg.

## Installation

This package `Luciole’ is meant to be installed automatically by TeXLive,
MikTeX, etc. Otherwise,  can be installed under TEXMFHOME or TEXMFLOCAL, f.i.
text fonts in directory texmf-local/fonts/truetype/public/luciole/,
math fonts in texmf-local/fonts/opentype/public/luciole/ and
luciole-math.sty, Luciole.fontspec in directory
texmf-local/tex/latex/luciole/.  
Documentation files and their sources can go to directory
texmf-local/doc/fonts/public/luciole/

Don't forget to rebuild the file database (mktexlsr or so) if you install
under TEXMFLOCAL.

Finally, make the system font database aware of the Luciole fonts
(fontconfig under Linux).

* v0.60
  - Improved design of large parentheses.
  - Invisible Math operators (U-2061 to U+2064) added.
